# print("Hello World!")

In this repository are uploaded my graded assignments and some exercises from the Masterschool Soft Eng Bootcamp I'm currently enrolled at.  
It showcases my learning journey, from foundational Python concepts to advanced programming techniques.

## ðŸŸ¢ Learning Path

Everything I'm learning in the Bootcamp.

### Tech Fundamentals & Intro to Programming with Python:

* Basics of programming: such as syntax, data types (integers, strings, floats, bools), variables, and simple operations.
* Algorithmic thinking: which involves developing problem-solving and logic-building skills.
* Text parsing and manipulation: input validation, string parsing and formating, regular expressions, data cleaning.
* List manipulation: Accessing elements (indexing, slicing), Modifying elements (appending, inserting, removing, sorting, searching)


### Intermediate Python

* Using IDEs: like Pycharm / VSCode for efficient coding and project management.
* Debugging: techniques and IDE tools for troubleshooting.
* Complex Types: dictionaries, tuples, sets and their methods.
* Importing modules: utilizing built-in and third-party Python modules.
* Control flow: looping (for loops, while loops) and conditional statements.
* Main and Functions: Structuring code, separating logic into small chunks or functions, writing a coherent main function.


### Advanced Python Syntax

* Creating full programs: coding standards for clean, readable, maintainable coding.
* Exception handling: For robust and 3rr0r-resistant code.
* Working with files: handling, reading, and writing data to files for persistent storage.
* Complex data structures: nested lists and dictionaries.
  * Iterating with Nested loops, List Comprehensions and lambda functions
  * Iterating with Nested loops and dictionary methods (.items(), .keys(), .values()).
  * Accessing dict values and safely modifying them with Key-chaining and .get()/.update().
* Version Control with Git and GitHub: tracking changes with commits, branching, collaborating in soft dev.

### Intro to Web

* HTML + CSS: Basics of web page structure and styling.
* Internet and HTTP: Foundations of web tech and communications protocols.
* JSON: Data exchange and representation.
* API: Using REST APIs for dynamic and interactive apps by doing requests.
* File Tree & Unit Testing with Pytest.

### OOP and Back-end apps

* Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
* Properties and Magic Methods: custom behaviour data objects.
* CRUD data handling: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
* Web servers with Flask framework: Setup, Managing, Routing and HTML Jinja templating.
* Creating an API: Building and Deployment with Flask.

### Databases

* Databases: Fundamentals, uses, exploration of different types of database systems.
* Relational databases: Structure and principles.
* SQL: Database querying and management.
* ORM: Object-Relational Mapping in Python apps with SQLAlchemy
