In this repository are uploaded my graded assignments and some exercises from the Masterschool Soft Eng Bootcamp I'm currently enrolled at.  
It showcases my learning journey, from foundational Python concepts to advanced programming techniques.  

## ðŸŸ¢ Completed Projects

You will find my complete projects in other repositories:  

<a href="https://github.com/VeronicaLobos/My-Zootopia-With-API">_My Zootopia with API_</a>:  
This program generates a simple html file with info extracted from an API.

<a href="https://github.com/VeronicaLobos/Best-Buy2">_BestBuy 2.0: OOP_</a>:  
Best Buy (this program) is a CLI that simulates a self-checkout TPV.
* A store object is generated along with product objects when the program runs (hard coded).
* The user interface prints a menu of actions available in a command dispatcher. 
* Users can check inventory from a store class object, which contains product class objects. 
* Users can check the total amount of units across all products in the store. 
* Users can order: grand total is shown and product quantity is updated.  

<a href="https://github.com/VeronicaLobos/Movie-Project-Phase2">_Movie Project Phase 2: OOP + Web_</a>:  
This project is a Python-based application that manages a movie database. 
* It allows users to interact with the database through a command-line interface (CLI), performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie data. 
* The project fetches movie data from the OMDb API and stores it in either a JSON file (movies.json) or a CSV file (data/movies.csv) for persistent storage. 
* It also includes a basic web page template to display movie information.

<a href="https://github.com/VeronicaLobos/Masterblog">_Masterblog_: Flask</a>:
This program is a simple Flask-based web blog application. It allows users to:
* View blog posts: Displayed on the main page (/).
* Like blog posts: Increase the like count for a specific post (/like/<int:post_id>).
* Add new blog posts: Create and publish new posts with author, title, date and content (/add).
* Delete blog posts: Remove existing posts (/delete/<int:post_id>).
* Update blog posts: Edit the content of existing posts (/update/<int:post_id>).
* The application uses a JSON file (blog_posts.json) to store and manage the blog post data, with the help of the HandleJson class (presumably defined in storage.handle_json). It utilizes Flask's routing and templating features to render HTML pages and handle user interactions.

## ðŸŸ¢ Learning Path

### Tech Fundamentals & Intro to Programming with Python:

* Basics of programming: such as syntax, data types (integers, strings, floats, bools), variables, and simple operations.
* Algorithmic thinking: which involves developing problem-solving and logic-building skills.
* Text parsing and manipulation: input validation, string parsing and formating, regular expressions, data cleaning.
* List manipulation: Accessing elements (indexing, slicing), Modifying elements (appending, inserting, removing, sorting, searching)


### Intermediate Python

* Using IDEs: like Pycharm / VSCode for efficient coding and project management.
* Debugging: techniques and IDE tools for troubleshooting.
* Complex Types: dictionaries, tuples, sets and their methods.
* Importing modules: utilizing built-in and third-party Python modules.
* Control flow: looping (for loops, while loops) and conditional statements.
* Main and Functions: Structuring code, separating logic into small chunks or functions, writing a coherent main function.


### Advanced Python Syntax

* Creating full programs: coding standards for clean, readable, maintainable coding.
* Exception handling: For robust and 3rr0r-resistant code.
* Working with files: handling, reading, and writing data to files for persistent storage.
* Complex data structures: nested lists and dictionaries.
  * Iterating with Nested loops, List Comprehensions and lambda functions
  * Iterating with Nested loops and dictionary methods (.items(), .keys(), .values()).
  * Accessing dict values and safely modifying them with Key-chaining and .get()/.update().
* Version Control with Git and GitHub: tracking changes with commits, branching, collaborating in soft dev.

### Intro to Web

* HTML + CSS: Basics of web page structure and styling.
* Internet and HTTP: Foundations of web tech and communications protocols.
* JSON: Data exchange and representation.
* API: Using REST APIs for dynamic and interactive apps by doing requests.
* File Tree & Unit Testing with Pytest.

### OOP and Back-end apps

* Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
* Properties and Magic Methods: custom behaviour data objects.
* CRUD data handling: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
* Web servers with Flask framework: Setup, Managing, Routing and HTML Jinja templating.
* Creating an API: Building and Deployment with Flask.

### Databases

* Databases: Fundamentals, uses, exploration of different types of database systems.
* Relational databases: Structure and principles.
* SQL: Database querying and management.
* ORM: Object-Relational Mapping in Python apps with SQLAlchemy
