ðŸ’ª Exercise

* Add 35 books to the static list you created in the
 Flask app in Codio (it can be fake books, or the same books).
* Run the Flask app from Codio.
* Write a script, on your computer, that interacts with Codioâ€™s
 Flask endpoint and reads 5 books at a time, until all the
 books are read.
 To clarify, your code on your computer needs to communicate
 with the API, in a loop, and read 5 books at a time.
 The code will loop until all the books are fetched.
