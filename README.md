# print("Hello World!")

This repository exists to keep track of my graded projects from a Soft Eng bootcamp I'm currently enrolled at.
Here I will learn how to make commits and push projects to Github and get comfortable with it while messing up.

## Intermediate Python

These projects are my first steps into Python, basic stuff.

## Proficient Python

In these projects I learn to divide tasks into smaller defined functions.
